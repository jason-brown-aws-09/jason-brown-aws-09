- 👋 Hi! My name is Jason Brown, and I am a Partner Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, AI, astronomy, chess, fishing, outdoors, and travel. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything all the time. I never stay stagnant. Technology moves fast!
- 💞️ I'm passionate about projects that simplify AWS use through automation, IaC, and AI and let SMB's spend time on their business instead of spending time at the console.
